# Shopping-System

The aim of the project is to implement an E-commerce website that provides these features to merchan-
disers and customers.

Through an E-commerce platform, customers can choose a product or service of their choice from any
vendor anywhere in the world without moving away from their workplace or home. They can also track
their delivery status and know when the goods are being sent to them. They can also choose the convenient
method of payment.

E-Commerce provides new channels for vendors to reach more customers. An online presence allows ven-
dors to provide more information about the products they are selling. Through E-commerce, sellers can

post different offers to their products to increase sales.
